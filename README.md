# Patched-Conic-Interplanetary-Earth-Jupiter-Trajectory-Analysis
An individual final class project for SJSU's astrodynamics (AE 142) course completed in my Spring 2023 semester. 

Inspired by the NASA Europa Clipper mission, I designed an approximated direct patched conic interplanetary trajectory for a spacecraft in Earth-Jupiter interplanetary transit using Europa Clipper's scheduled launch date and rocket provider, starting with a circular orbit around Earth, already on its ecliptic plane, followed by a heliocentric Hohmann transfer ellipse upon departure from Earth's sphere of influence, and ending at a circular orbit around Jupiter at twice the orbital altitude of Europa around Jupiter. 

Employed combination of planetary and orbital mechancis research, carefully derived list of assumptions, ephemeris data via the JPL Horizons database, and problem objective downscaling to bring this project to fruition within the available project timeframe of ~2 months.

Compared hand-calculated results to trajectory simulations using GMAT and Matlab open source scripts (employing the Lambert function), both of which have ultimately converged.

Demonstrated key considerations and methods for interplanetary planning process, trajectory maneuvers, including the use of simplified models using 2D and 3D body dynamics, and explored parameters and constraints used in realistic trajectory optimization efforts.
